## Background
This data was collected by data professionals in the year 2022, and questionnaires were distributed to data professionals around the world to discover how they got into data roles, the industry they work in, how happy they are in their role, their salary per year etc.
Business Problem
1. What are the average salaries of different data professional roles?
2. What is the distribution of survey respondents across various countries?
3. Which data analytics tools and programming languages are commonly utilized by data professionals?
4. Are data professionals satisfied with their salary levels and work-life balance in their current roles?
5. How do data professionals perceive the difficulty of entering data roles in terms of ease or challenge?

## Data Wrangling
The raw data was loaded into the Power Query Editor, which served as the initial stage for data preparation and cleansing. Within this environment, various data cleaning techniques were employed to enhance the quality and integrity of the dataset.
Firstly, missing values and duplicate records were systematically identified and addressed. Missing values were either removed or imputed using appropriate methods, while duplicate records were eliminated to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Additionally, data type mismatches were rectified by converting the data types to their correct formats. This step ensured proper representation of the data and enabled accurate analysis.
After undergoing these comprehensive data cleaning processes, the dataset was thoroughly scrubbed and refined, resulting in a high-quality and reliable dataset, ready for further analysis and exploration. Furthermore, to facilitate easier analysis, the columns were transformed from a wide format to a long format.
The Power Query Editor played a pivotal role in streamlining the data cleaning process, offering a user-friendly interface and a robust set of tools for transforming and shaping the data according to the desired requirements. The cleaned and prepared dataset was then made available for subsequent analysis, ensuring that any insights derived would be based on high-quality, consistent, and reliable data.

## Analysis and Findings 
The analysis was conducted based on 613 survey responses, with an average respondent age of 30 years old. The findings revealed significant differences in average salaries across various data-related professions. Data scientists earned the highest average salary of $93.78 per year, which is 44% higher than the average salary of $65.09 for data engineers. Data architects received an average salary of $63.67, only $1.42 lower than data engineers. Other tech professions, including business/financial analysts, business intelligence professionals, BI developers, FP&A analysts, business consultants, supply chain analysts, research analysts, and SAP security analysts, had an average salary of $60.96 per year. Data analysts earned an average of $55.42, while database developers and students in data fields received averages of $33.20 and $26.39 per year, respectively.
The survey respondents were from various countries, including the United States, India, Canada, the United Kingdom, and other regions. The United States had the highest representation with 258 respondents (42%), followed by other countries (primarily from Europe, Asia, and Africa) with 35% of respondents. Canada had the lowest number of respondents at 32 (5%), compared to 38 (6%) from the United Kingdom and 70 (11%) from India.
Regarding the ease of breaking into data roles, 24.68% of respondents found it very easy, 23.08% found it easy, 19.09% found it difficult, 19.05% found it neither easy nor difficult, and 14.09% found it very difficult.
More than half of the respondents expressed satisfaction with their work-life balance in their current roles. However, a significant portion were not satisfied with their salaries, indicating that while data professionals enjoy the flexibility of their work, they may desire better compensation.
In terms of programming languages, Python emerged as the most commonly used language, particularly among data analysts. R programming was the second most common, also widely used by data analysts. SQL, SAS, Power BI, and Excel were the third most commonly used tools, primarily by data analysts. Languages such as C/C++, JavaScript, and Java were not as frequently utilized in data roles.


## Recommendations for Data Professionals 
Based on the analysis, here are some potential recommendations for data professionals:
#### 1.	Skill Development: 
o	Focus on developing proficiency in Python, as it is the most used programming language across various data roles, particularly for data analysts.
o	Gain expertise in R programming, SQL, SAS, Power BI, and Excel, as these tools are also widely used by data professionals, especially data analysts.
o	Continuously update skills and knowledge to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving data field.
#### 2.	Career Growth: 
o	For those aspiring to higher salaries, consider pursuing roles such as data scientist or data architect, as they command higher average salaries compared to other data professions.
#### 3.	Work-Life Balance: 
o	Prioritize roles and companies that offer a good work-life balance, as data professionals value the flexibility to strike a healthy balance between their professional and personal lives.
These recommendations aim to provide data professionals with strategies to enhance their skills, explore career growth opportunities, maintain work-life balance.
